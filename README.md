# hanabi-enseirb-2020


The aim is to rise to the challenge offered by Deepmind [[1]](#Bard_2020). \
One promising lead is offered by Facebook [[2]](#lerer2019improving).

## Objectives

Our first main goal is to rise to the first challenge, which is when the game happens with the same agent playing with himself.

Then, we'll move on to the next challenge which is to play with different agents.
